# USELESS-MODULE-PYTHON
An python module, that is completly useless, yet still fun to use, this module is free to use and can use it where ever you want, one thing, the file (useless.py) must be in the same folder as the same python file where you want to use the module, or it will drop an error. That out of the Way, have fun with it!
